# Changes Made to the Masterpiece Design Document:

## Choice of APIs ##
- From Goodreads to Wikiquote
    - Wikiquote provides a greater variety of information and more detailed information. The functionality of Goodreads was too limited and its documentation was not that great for our usage.
- From IBM Watson Conversation Service to API AI 
    - While both APIs offered very similar things, API AI’s documentation and tutorials were more helpful for a beginner.
## Routing ##
- After signing in, user goes to library instead of workshop.
    - There are more documents to look at in library, workshop is empty as a new user)
- Instead of having the chatbot on the doc route (along with the actual document), it has a separate route, which can be accessed through a button.
    - It was difficult to put them on the same page.
## Features ##
- No procrastination block
    - There wasn’t enough time to work on it because attempting to integrate Google Docs took longer than expected.
- Chatbot limitations
    - There was nothing in the API that allowed the bot to recognize book titles, so there will be no quote if you search for a book.
- No Google Docs
    - The documentation was too limited for our purposes. At most, we were able to get the login to work.
