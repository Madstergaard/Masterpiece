What it does:
- Masterpiece is "Google Docs on steroids." Our website allows users the functionality of Google Docs while giving users more features to help them gain inspiration for their writing. One feature is the library of public writings that any user of the site can contribute. Another feature is our Chatbot that helps users brainstorm by providing quotes relevant to a topic.

How to use:
- Sign Up or Login.
- Check out our library, a collection of user writings/documents.
- Create your own document.
- Use our brainstorming Chatbot for inspiration
- View your previous documents in "My Workshop"

Notable (bugs/cool stuff):
- Our logo is a cool typing animation.
- The JavaScript for the document captions take some time to load.
